Our Topic:  Build a website or app that can help users create and manage a personalized
investmentÂ portfolio.

Work Done:

1. We are using the Flask framework of python inorder to accomodate our idea. We have built the following webpages

    1.1 Base.html - the basic template
    1.2 Watchlist.html - the page where the user can see the list of all his stocks (yet to be completed)
    1.3 help.html - this page refers to the FAQ section for a begineer
    1.4 news.html - this new and dynamic web pages gives fresh news updates from the business world to the user
    1.5 creators.html - this is an introduction about our team
    
2. Login and Signup webpages are built using different kinds of validators, which stores the sensitive data of user in an encrypted form
   and uses sqlite for the same
  

Future Work:

1. We plan to make an interactive dashboard which will give the user state of the art features, like investment analysis, shares, etc.
2. The webpages would be made more interactive using CSS and JavaScript
